# Socio-historical Context and Impact Report

## Socio-historical Context

### Who are the major stakeholders?
<br />
The major stakeholders include: the city of Chicago, the people of Chicago who get tested/ use ride share apps, the users of the data (us), and those who will use our predictions. <br /><br />

### Societal factors affecting our data and prediction
<br />
Due to the declining covid cases of covid the number of tests are beginning to decline which may make using the data of more recent dates more difficult. A majority of people are going back to their day to day lives and the effect of covid on ride share apps may be dwindling which is something we must consider when building our model.<br /><br />


#### What should we do?
<br />
This data can still be used as a reference for when there is another covid spike or for a separate pandemic. 
<br /><br />

## Ethical Considerations

### Biases in data collection
<br />
This may actually eliminate bias, but it is important to note that data was not collected during holiday periods due to atypical travel patterns.<br /><br />

### Biases in data interpretation



### Privacy issues and solutions

http://dev.cityofchicago.org/open%20data/data%20portal/2019/04/12/tnp-taxi-privacy.html
This data has been collected in a way which protects the user's identity. As explained in the link above “data about an individual’s location at certain points in time can create a “fingerprint” that can allow for re identification, as long as there is a separate dataset available containing parts of the fingerprint along with identifying fields.”. The article explains the possible privacy issues of collecting this data and offers a solution stating “datasets have been aggregated in a way that protects passenger personal privacy by avoiding reidentification,”. The file goes on to explain, the methods in which privacy is maintained. This will not be included in this document due to its length but can be referenced in the link above.

### Misuses of our project results

Rideshare companies can use our prediction models and use it to their advantage to make a greater profit on their side. If they see that people are still using rideshare even with higher prices especially during a time of hardship such as a pandemic, they may see that as an opportunity to take advantage of the users and spike up their prices. From a user perspective if they see that rideshare prices become cheaper due to the pandemic they may be inclined to falsify information to spread fear in hopes of a cheaper ride.
